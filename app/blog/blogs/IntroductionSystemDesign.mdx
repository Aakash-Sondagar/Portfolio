## What is System Design?
System design is the process of taking a set of requirements and building a product that fulfills those requirements.

## Let’s Design a System
Let’s consider the example of building Facebook to understand system design better.

### Architecture
- To design a system like Facebook, the first step is deciding on the architecture.
- Key architectural components include:
  - **Database**: To store user data.
  - **API Server**: To serve requests from users and other systems.
  - **CDNs (Content Delivery Networks)**: To efficiently serve assets like images.
- The high-level architecture defines which all component are required, how these components interact and fit together.

### Components
- Once the architecture is in place, the next step is identifying the major components needed to power the system.
- For example, in Facebook:
  - One component handles **Authentication and Authorization**.
  - Within this component, we might need:
    - **1 App Server** to process authentication logic.
    - **1 Database** to store user credentials securely.
    - **1 Cache** to speed up repeated queries.

### Modules
- After deciding on the components, the final step is breaking them into modules.
- For each component, determine what modules are required to implement it effectively.
- For example:
  - The **Authentication and Authorization** component can have modules like:
    - User registration.
    - Login and session management.
    - Token validation.

### Bringing It All Together
- System design involves three strong pillars:
  1. **Architecture**: The overall blueprint of the system.
  2. **Components**: The building blocks of the system.
  3. **Modules**: The smaller pieces within components that handle specific tasks.
- More importantly, system design ensures that all these different parts come together and interact seamlessly to solve the bigger problem—in this case, building Facebook.

## The Product Development Lifecycle
In organizations, product development typically follows this structure:
1. **Architecture** → 2. **Components** → 3. **Modules**

Every single tech product is a “system” that has been “designed.”

## When We Design a System
When designing a system, we:
1. Break down the problem statement into solvable sub-problems.
2. Decide on the key components and their responsibilities.
3. Define the boundaries (scope) of each component.
4. Address key challenges in scaling the system.
5. Make the architecture fault-tolerant and reliable (available).

By following these steps, we can design systems that are scalable, robust, and effective in solving real-world problems.
