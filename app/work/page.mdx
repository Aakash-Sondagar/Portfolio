        At <a href="https://www.wohlig.com/" className="link-primary">Wohlig</a>, I architect and build scalable solutions that power businesses. My journey began with modernizing legacy systems for <a href="https://www.aon.com/apac/sites/india/aon-risk-insurance-broker/default" className="link-primary">Global Insurance</a>, where I contributed across the full development spectrum.
      </p>

      <p>
        As Wohlig evolved into a <a href="https://cloud.google.com/find-a-partner/partner/wohlig-transformations-pvt-ltd" className="link-primary">Google Cloud Partner</a>, I immersed myself in cloud technologies, specializing in migration and infrastructure optimization. This journey deepened my expertise in cloud architecture and best practices.
      </p>

      <p>
        My role expanded beyond development to include technical leadership and pre-sales activities. From crafting SOWs to designing system architectures, I've gained comprehensive insights into building end-to-end solutions. Notable projects include <a href="https://www.shadowfax.in/" className="link-primary">Shadowfax</a>, <a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/" className="link-primary">Moneycontrol</a>, <a href="https://www.wildworks.com/#welcome" className="link-primary">WildWorks</a>, and <a href="https://erosnow.com/" className="link-primary">Erosnow</a>.
