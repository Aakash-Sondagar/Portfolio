## Work

<AnimatedName />

On a mission to build products, and along the way, learn the next generation of technology.
Here's a summary of my work so far.

### Wohlig

<Small>Software Development Engineer, July 2023 - Current</Small>

I joined [Wohlig](https://www.wohlig.com/) as a Software Engineer(my first full-time job).
My journey began with a migration project for our client,
[Global Insurance](https://www.aon.com/apac/sites/india/aon-risk-insurance-broker/default).
From building UI interfaces to writing APIs, optimizing systems, and fixing vulnerability issues,
I contributed as a full-stack developer.

As Wohlig became a
[Google Cloud partner](https://cloud.google.com/find-a-partner/partner/wohlig-transformations-pvt-ltd),
the scope of our projects expanded to include development and deployment on GCP.
This gave me the opportunity to dive into DevOps and cloud technologies.
I had the privilege of contributing to projects for [Erosnow](https://erosnow.com/) 
and [FanCraze](https://www.fancraze.com/).

With time, my roles and responsibilities grew. I started leading projects,
which taught me valuable lessons about client interactions and provided in-depth knowledge of end-to-end systems—from code to infrastructure.
Some of the key projects I’ve worked on include [Mzaalo](https://www.mzaalo.com/), 
[Credilio](https://www.credilio.in/), and more exciting ones are on the way.

### Wohlig

<Small>SDE Intern, Jan 2022 - July 2022</Small>

I joined Wohlig for a semester-long internship as an SDE Intern during the 6th semester of my B.Tech. 
This experience gave me valuable insights into how the software industry works.

During my internship, I learned the JavaScript-based tech stack (MERN stack). 
I worked on [TerraCor](https://apps.apple.com/in/app/terra-cor-diamonds/id1539937063), 
where I built several end-to-end features and optimized the workflow.
