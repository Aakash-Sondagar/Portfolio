At [Wohlig](https://www.wohlig.com/), I architect and build scalable solutions that power businesses. My journey began with modernizing legacy systems for [Global Insurance](https://www.aon.com/apac/sites/india/aon-risk-insurance-broker/default), where I contributed across the full development spectrum.

As Wohlig evolved into a [Google Cloud Partner](https://cloud.google.com/find-a-partner/partner/wohlig-transformations-pvt-ltd), I immersed myself in cloud technologies, specializing in migration and infrastructure optimization. This journey deepened my expertise in cloud architecture and best practices.

My role expanded beyond development to include technical leadership and pre-sales activities. From crafting SOWs to designing system architectures, I've gained comprehensive insights into building end-to-end solutions. Notable projects include [Shadowfax](https://www.shadowfax.in/), [Moneycontrol](https://www.moneycontrol.com/), [WildWorks](https://www.wildworks.com/#welcome), and [Erosnow](https://erosnow.com/).
